# Canvas Structured Items - Feature Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Convert Note to Structured Item**
- **Trigger**: Command palette OR right-click in note
- **Features**:
  - Adds structured frontmatter to existing notes
  - Merges with existing frontmatter (preserves other fields)
  - Optional snake_case renaming with auto-increment
  - Auto-syncs to Notion if enabled

### 2. **Auto-Delete on Canvas Removal**
- **Trigger**: When a node is removed from canvas
- **Safety**:
  - Only deletes plugin-created notes (checks frontmatter)
  - Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Moves to trash (not permanent delete)
  - Deletes from all canvases immediately

### 3. **Automatic Canvas Refresh**
- **Fixed**: Canvas now auto-reloads when items are added
- **Result**: No more manual close/reopen needed
- **Benefit**: Cards are immediately movable and connectable

### 4. **Smart File Naming**
- **Format**: `{ID}_{snake_case_title}.md`
- **Examples**: 
  - `T001_implement_feature.md`
  - `A005_project_milestone_2.md` (auto-incremented)
- **Prevents**: Accidental file overwrites

## 🐛 Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Canvas Monitoring**: There's a 1-2 second delay in detecting node deletions
2. **Multiple Canvas Views**: If multiple views of same canvas are open, might cause race conditions
3. **Frontmatter Validation**: Only notes with complete structured frontmatter are recognized as plugin-created

## 🔄 Next Steps

**User should:**
1. **Reload Obsidian** to load the new plugin version
2. **Test all four workflows** above
3. **Report any issues** with specific error messages from logs

**If issues occur:**
- Check `.obsidian/logs/canvas-structured-items/log.txt`
- Look for TypeScript/JavaScript errors in Obsidian's dev console (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
- Verify frontmatter format in test notes
